# Folder-Manager

A command-line application written in Go that uses topic modeling to intelligently organize, search, and manage files on your local system. Designed for developers, researchers, and anyone handling large volumes of unstructured files, this tool blends manual control with automated file categorization based on file content.

- **Manual Move Support**  
  Manually move files using CLI commands when needed.
